# Topic: Wellness

## Subtopic: Healthy Lifestyle Gamification:
Encourage wellness through gamification. Develop a game that rewards users for
making healthy choices, such as staying active, eating nutritious meals, or taking breaks
during work. Progress could be tracked through levels, badges, or rewards that motivate
users to stick to their wellness journey.

## Subtopic 2: Personalized Wellness Journeys:
Create a tool that helps users design a personalized wellness plan tailored to their
unique needs and goals. This could involve fitness routines, mental health practices, or
healthy eating habits, all integrated into a single platform that tracks progress and
adjusts to the user’s evolving lifestyle.

## Subtopic 3: Integrating Technology for Wellness:
Explore how emerging technologies such as AI, wearables, or IoT devices can improve
overall wellness. Your project might focus on syncing fitness trackers with personalized
wellness plans or using AI to monitor mental health and provide real-time suggestions for
improvement.
